	/**
	 * Creates a new set of parameters for blurring an image according to its depth and a blur function
	 * 
	 * @param relativeInflectionDepth
	 *            A value between 0 and 1 representing the relative distance between the minimal image depth (as 0) and
	 *            maximal image depth (as 1) where the blur function inflects. More accurately, where the second
	 *            derivative of the function is 0
	 * @param smoothness
	 *            A strictly positive number (&gt; 0) that controls the smoothness of the blur function. A larger value
	 *            gives a more smooth function. More accurately, the first derivative is reduced with a higher value for
	 *            smoothness
	 * @param maxBlurPixelRadius
	 *            The pixel radius used for blurring one image pixel at the maximum level of blurring
	 * @param maxRelativeDepthSimilarity
	 *            The maximum relative (i.e., between 0 and 1) difference in depth for nearby pixels to be considered
	 *            part of the same surface and hence blurrable. This threshold is an effective measure to retain
	 *            sharpness of edges on nearby objects which partly cover far, blurred objects from sight
